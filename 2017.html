			<b>Jay's notes:</b><br> 
			<i>
			We also had early this morning NASDAQ security DCIX dropping towards 20% and when we checked the 30 day chart we saw no history over the last thirty days and that is a red flag.  When we checked ETRADE for news, nothing was shown and that was the case with Street Insider - as the last date of news was a

			SEC filing on October 31st. </a>

			 


			  We clicked on that and see there is a 1:7 reverse stock split slated for today and suddenly everything makes sense and we know why there was no 30 day chart (at that time), because Big Charts did not have time to update their data field.<br><br>

			On reverse stock splits, that were announced in advance (as this one was), we were looking for a 25-30% drop before engaging the stock

			Jay's notes:<br><br>
			<i> So how do we handle a stock like NVCN?<br><br>


There are three approaches and the first involves having a firm exit strategy where you know where you want to sell for a profit and where you will sell if the stock continues to drop in price.  If you buy a news stock like NVCN you might look for a 5% gain and are willing to accept an 8% loss and you set your conditional order accordingly.  Here, in today's example, the stock would have quickly sold as the stock dropped - locking in your loss, but at a much smaller amount an if you would simply let it ride.<br><br>


The second approach involves buying the shares you are after at your price and then waiting through the day to see if the stock recovers back to your entry price so you can sell at a break even exit.  <br><br>


The third approaches involves using a portion (say half) of the money you would normally use on a stock and then if the new security drops an additional 15-20% past your purchase price, you use the other half in order to lower the break even price and then allow the stock to recover so you can sell at a lower breakeven point.<br><br>


As long as you see a 70% or better batting average, I do not care which strategy best works for you.  For some, taking a smaller loss early on is the way to go, while others are perfectly content to allow their stock to drop and (hopefully) recover back to the point where the shares were purchased.  Others will expect the stock to continue dropping which is why they will spend half in the initial order and then will wait for the stock to continue dropping before deploying the next round of cash.<br><br></i>

			Since this one was a high-risk and I missed the low by 4.21%, just get out.  Maybe go for 29% next time.<br><br>

			Good thing I got out when I did, because it went up to $2.33 and then went back down.
